# COEPriceAssignment - DMBA (Business Elective)
COE Price Predictor using SAS EM


# Background
In this assignment, we will make use of the COE prices retrieved from
LTA Data Mall. We will make use of the data to train predictive models
that can satisfactorily predict COE prices for the Open Category.

# Problem Statement
Conventional wisdom tells us that the more bids there are, the higher
the COE prices. However are there any other seasonal or external
factors affecting COE prices?
